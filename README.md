# ChainChat - Decentralized Messaging and Friend Request DApp

ChainChat is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to connect with each other, send messages, and manage friend requests. It offers a secure and private way for users to interact, much like popular messaging apps, but with the added benefit of blockchain technology.

## Features

ChainChat offers the following key features:

1. **User Registration:** Users can create an account by providing a unique username.

2. **Friend Requests:** Users can send friend requests to others by specifying their Ethereum addresses. These requests can be accepted or rejected.

3. **Messaging:** Once users become friends, they can send and receive messages securely.

4. **Friend List:** Users can view their list of friends.

5. **User Directory:** Users can explore a directory of all registered users on the platform.

## Smart Contract

The core functionality of ChainChat is implemented through a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract manages user registration, friend requests, messaging, and user data. Key components of the smart contract include:

- User registration and management.
- Friend requests, including sending, accepting, and rejecting requests.
- Messaging between friends.
- Storing user data and managing user profiles.

## Technologies Used

ChainChat is built using the following technologies:

- **React:** The front-end interface of the DApp is developed using React, providing a user-friendly experience.

- **Ether.js:** Ether.js is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to send transactions and read data from the smart contract.

- **Hardhat:** Hardhat is used for smart contract development, testing, and deployment.

- **Chakra UI:** Chakra UI is used for designing the user interface, providing a consistent and attractive look.

## Getting Started

To get started with ChainChat, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

3. Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain using Hardhat. Follow the [Steps](https://github.com/roudra323/DApp-Boilerplate) if you stuck. 

4. Start the front-end application using `npm start`.

5. Connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask or other compatible wallets) to the DApp.

6. Register your account, send friend requests, and start messaging with friends.
